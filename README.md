# Pwn-The-Box

## Summary

Running `start.sh` spins up three docker containers. The first is a `mongoDB` backend to the `node` container. The `node` container presents a login page at `172.18.0.2:5000/login`. There's no sign-up option, however you can use a timing attack to enumerate a username. This happens because when you supply a valid username, the code proceeds to use `bcrypt.compare` to evaluate the submitted password against the stored hash, however the code exits before the supplied password is compared to the hash for invalid usernames. A simple brute-force finds the password almost immediately for the found username.

After authenticating, we're presented with an option to search, however any search requests yields a `403 Unauthorized`. Inspecting the cookies we find we've been set a JWT. Decoding the JWT shows two things of interest:
1. A field `isAdmin` in the payload set to `false`
2. The `kid` field in the header is set to `../../../etc/passwd`

The `kid` is a field the server uses to determine which key was used in the signature. It appears the server is uing the `/etc/passwd` as the key. This may seem secure at first as we've no idea what the server's `/etc/passwd` looks like. However if we supply a file for the `kid` we reliably know will be the same on the server as for us, we can forge a token. A good file to use is `/dev/null` as it's the same and present across every Linux system. So we can set `isAdmin: true` and `kid: '/dev/null'`, and forge a token which the server will successfully verify. 

Now we have access to the search functionality. Testing `noSQL` injection payloads doesn't appear to work, however if we proxy the request through Burpsuite and change the `Content-Type` to `application/json` we find some success with the payload 
```
{
    "username": {"$ne":  null}
}```
